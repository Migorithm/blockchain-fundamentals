## Why not just database?
- No admin
- Most blockchains are engineered to be permissionless
- Only have insert operations - inherently immutable
  - This implies that blockchains are not recursive in nature: no repeat


## Web3? 
This is quite a confusing term. This essentially means "internet of blockchains."
Until web 2.0, we had client-server architecture applications. 
As the blockchain promises more decentralized internet, now it's called web3.
